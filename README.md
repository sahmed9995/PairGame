Tic-Tac-Toe is a game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O.  

The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.  It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.

## Features


- Two player interaction with score tally
- Robust options including Instructions, Gameplay, and Exit from the menu. 
- Automatically resets to start next game.

> The overriding design goal for this project was to take an existing game framework and build upon it, adding user-friendly features that makes this project both easy to understand while using modern technologies.

## Gameplay

Tic-tac-toe is played on a three-by-three grid by two players, who alternately place the marks X and O in one of the nine spaces in the grid.

There is no universally-agreed rule as to who plays first, but in this article the convention that X plays first is used.

Because of the simplicity of tic-tac-toe, it is often used as a pedagogical tool for teaching the concepts of good sportsmanship and the branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the searching of game trees. 

It is straightforward to write a computer program to play tic-tac-toe perfectly or to enumerate the 765 essentially different positions (the state space complexity) or the 26,830 possible games up to rotations and reflections (the game tree complexity) on this space. If played optimally by both players, the game always ends in a draw, making tic-tac-toe a futile game.
